CREATING ALBANY BLOCK GROUP GEOID LIST

Could just merge blocks from files pedro provided. However for more confirmation, I filtered the Alameda county block groups from the all California 2019 block group file. Then overlayed those with Pedro's blocks using vs-code map plugin to see which block groups made up Albany map. 

files: 

    inputs: 

        inputs/tl_2019_06_bg/tl_2019_06_bg.shp - all California block groups. downloaded from downloaded from https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/BG/tl_2019_06_bg.zip
        
        inputs/from_pedro/Files/Albany CA Census Blocks.shp - Albany blocks from Pedro. Source unknown.

    outputs:

        alameda/2019_bg/bg.shp - filtered Alameda block groups.

        albany/2019_bg_geoids.txt - list of Albany block groups GEOIDs from visual map inspection.

        albany/pedro_census_blocks.geojson - converted Pedro file
